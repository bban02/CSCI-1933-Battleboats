The best way to compile and run my code would be to use an IDE such as intellij,
but you can also just download all 4 of my classes and compile all of them by
typing on your keyboard, "javac Classname.java" and the only class that you
would need to run is the game class which you can do by typing on your keyboard,
"java Game".

Assumptions:
You must have something that can run a java program
User must enter numbers in spots specified
